# Authentication Configuration

## Overview
The application uses better-auth for authentication, replacing the previous Supabase implementation.

## Components

- Provides user session information to child components
- Handles loading states and authentication flow
- Uses better-auth client for session management

### AuthForm
- Handles user sign-in and sign-up

- Uses better-auth client for authentication operations

## Environment Variables

## Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials in AuthForm
2. AuthForm submits credentials to better-auth
3. On successful authentication:
   - Session is created
   - User state is updated
   - Redirect to protected content
4. On error:
   - Error message is displayed
   - User can retry
