# Authentication Configuration

## Auth Client Setup
- Base URL configured to use VITE_APP_URL environment variable with localhost:5173 fallback
- Using better-auth customSessionClient plugin without custom configuration
- Exports standard auth functions: signIn, signUp, signOut, useSession, getSession, $fetch

## Authentication Flow
- Session management handled by better-auth
- Default session configuration used for cookies and storage
- Type-safe auth client implementation using TypeScript

## Security Considerations
- Environment variables used for sensitive configuration
- Secure cookie handling through better-auth defaults
- Type safety enforced through TypeScript generics

## Overview
The application uses better-auth for authentication, replacing the previous Supabase implementation.

## Components

### AuthProvider
- Manages authentication state using React Context
- Provides user session information to child components
- Handles loading states and authentication flow
- Uses better-auth client for session management

### AuthForm
- Handles user sign-in and sign-up
- Supports email/password authentication
- Includes form validation and error handling
- Uses better-auth client for authentication operations

## Environment Variables
Required environment variables for authentication:
- GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
- GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

## Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials in AuthForm
2. AuthForm submits credentials to better-auth
3. On successful authentication:
   - Session is created
   - User state is updated
   - Redirect to protected content
4. On error:
   - Error message is displayed
   - User can retry

## Social Authentication
Supported providers:
- GitHub
- Google

## Session Management
- Sessions are managed by better-auth
- AuthProvider listens for session changes
- Automatic session refresh handling
