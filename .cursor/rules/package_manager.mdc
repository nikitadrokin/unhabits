# Package Manager Configuration

## Current Package Manager
- Use `bun` as the primary package manager for the project
- Prefer `bun` commands over npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Use `bunx` for one-off package executions instead of npx/pnpx

## Commands to Use
- Installation: `bun install`
- Adding dependencies: `bun add [package]`
- Adding dev dependencies: `bun add -d [package]`
- Running scripts: `bun run [script]`
- Package execution: `bunx [package]`

## Migration Notes
- Remove other lock files if present (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml)
- Keep only bun.lockb for dependency locking
- Update CI/CD pipelines to use bun instead of other package managers
